# Rebuild
Last updated: 2022-11-13

### Summary
After my first year of fatherhood and with everything going on *gestures wildly* in the world and the internet, I’ve decided it’s time to rebuild. I’m not just talking about just my personal website. I’m talking about reworking how I build. How I extract ideas, track them, evaluate them and build them. Part of that will include rebuilding populate web apps like Instagram, Notion and Twitter, to provide not only fun exercises of building well known real world applications, but as web companies continue to obsess over monetizing attention and data, this will allow me to find new homes for my own data that I can control and experiment with.
 
Getting back to basics and foundational principles. First principles?

### What it could be
* A focused step by step chronicling of progress in an attempt to relearn how to best work on pet or side projects while also prioritizing my family and full time work.
* Something fun to share with family, friends and/or internet randos that either find this inspiring or are just curious.
* A fun experiment and chance to exercise some new (and old) skills.
* Format will most likely consistent of everything incrementally stored and updated in git, to ensure a change log and history.

### What it won’t be
* Video, audio or long form content.
* Regularly scheduled.
* Live-streamed in any fashion.
