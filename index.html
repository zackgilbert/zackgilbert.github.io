<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>After my first year of fatherhood and with everything going on in the world and on the internet, I’ve decided it’s time to rebuild. I’m not talking about just <a href="http://zackgilbert.com">my personal website</a>, but about reworking <em>how</em> I build: how I extract ideas, track them, evaluate them and build them. I’d like to start by reorganizing and rebuilding my own personal web tools and properties, but will also explore cloning popular web apps, like Instagram, Notion and Twitter, as fun exercises of rebuilding well known real world applications. This will allow me to find a new dedicated home for my own projects and data that I can control and play with. The hope is to use this experiment to get back to basics and first principles, to rebuild strong foundations that can easily be expanded upon in the future, and to just have some fun building on the web again (something that feels lost at the moment).</p>

<h3 id="rules-and-guildines">Rules & Guidelines</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Not intentionally starting a business. It can happen accidentally, but I am not focusing on landing pages or marketing. If someone likes what I'm building and wants to buy it, great. But that's not the goal right now.</li>
  <li>Only one project idea at a time. If I come up with new ideas, they need to get added to the idea's spreadsheet and explored later. But I can only actively work on once project at a time. This is an exercise in focus.</li>
  <li>It's okay to learn new technology. It's also okay to build worthless projects that help learn a new concept or technology. Just play and have fun and get more comfortable.</li>
  <li>Using AI is not only allowed, but it is highly encouraged.</li>
  <li>Building tools to help improve my productivity with building is highly encouraged. In fact, a large chunk of the work should be related to refining the whole build process. The goal is to move faster. <a href="https://twitter.com/levelsio/status/1595427845538562050">The first couple steps matter</a>.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-it-could-be">What it could be</h3>
<ul>
  <li>A focused step by step chronicling of progress in an attempt to relearn how to best work on side projects while also prioritizing my family and full time work.</li>
  <li>Something fun to share with family, friends and/or internet randos that either find this inspiring or are just curious.</li>
  <li>A fun experiment and chance to exercise some new (and old) skills.</li>
  <li>Format will most likely consist of everything incrementally stored and updated in git, to ensure a change log and history.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="what-it-wont-be">What it won’t be</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Video, audio or long form content.</li>
  <li>Regularly scheduled.</li>
  <li>Live-streamed in any fashion.</li>
</ul>
